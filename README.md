# Consistency

They say the most important thing in any endeavor is *consistency*. This is where I'll try to write something *every day*. It won't be much, probably just a link or two to something I've read. All the entries will be chronological, with the newest at the top.

+ Maybe you're like me: sometimes you use Pandas, but you don't really *know* Pandas. If so, [this *extensive* visual guide to Pandas](https://betterprogramming.pub/pandas-illustrated-the-definitive-visual-guide-to-pandas-c31fa921a43) may be for you. (Note: This is hosted on Medium so you may be able to view it or you may not. Who knows...)

+ Looks like Z Library [isn't going down without a fight](https://torrentfreak.com/z-library-returns-on-the-clearnet-in-full-hydra-mode-230213/).
+ I'm a big fan of using programming languages for doing CAD work. [GhostSCAD]() puts a Go wrapper around OpenSCAD to achieve that. CadQuery (Python) and JSCad (Javascript) are other alternatives mentioned in the comments.
+ [Maya Posch](https://hackaday.com/author/mayaposch/) writes a lot of good articles at Hackaday like this one on [methane pyrolysis](https://hackaday.com/2023/02/13/methane-pyrolysis-producing-green-hydrogen-without-carbon-emissions/). Also check out the [mining and refining](https://hackaday.com/tag/mining-and-refining/) section by [Dan Maloney](https://hackaday.com/author/dpsm64/) for facts about the stuff that makes up our industrial society.

### Feb 12, 2023
+ Japan is going [full bore on nuclear](https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/business/companies/20230210-90175/). Looks like the government will be paying for their share of the build-out by charging "carbon fees" to companies using fossil fuels.
+ Looks like Intel Foundry service [isn't going to be directly supporting RISC-V](https://www.electropages.com/blog/2023/01/intel-terminates-risc-v-development-project-what-happened).

### Feb 11, 2023
+ You can get a lot of prepackaged Docker containers for FOSS EDA tools [here](https://hdl.github.io/containers/). [This page](https://hdl.github.io/containers/ToolsAndImages.html) lists the available tools. Most of these are HDL/FPGA/VLSI design tools so don't expect to get containers for things like KiCad and FreeCAD.
+ A while ago, I built a [Docker container for KiCad](https://github.com/devbisme/docker_kicad5). It's for version 5, but it should be easy to modify it for versions 6 and 7 (when it becomes available).

------------------------------------------
### Feb 10, 2023
+ [Here's](https://www.hackster.io/news/one-man-s-trash-is-another-man-s-compute-cluster-b6735c5d8385) the latest effort to repurpose old smartphones into a compute cluster. Unfortunately, the phones are loaded with the [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubuntu-touch.io/) linux variant and that isn't supported on any of the old phones I have lieing around.
+ A couple of pro-nuke articles about [uninformed fears of nuclear waste](https://zionlights.substack.com/p/everything-i-believed-about-waste-was-wrong) and [the nuclear renaissance](https://quillette.com/2023/02/09/the-dawn-of-nuclear-energy-abundance/).

### Feb 9, 2023
+ Instead of [running Doom on a soldering iron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCC941xKuBs), it seems the new trend is to implement ChatGPT in as few lines as possible. [Here's one](https://jaykmody.com/blog/gpt-from-scratch/) that does it in 60 lines of NumPy.

### Feb 8, 2023
+ Last week, America was incensed that [a Chinese spy ballon traversed our airspace](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-briefed-40-nations-china-spy-balloon-incident-diplomats-official-say-2023-02-08/). This week, we learned that [we blew up Russia's Nordstream gas supply lines](https://seymourhersh.substack.com/p/how-america-took-out-the-nord-stream?r=5mz1)...

### Feb 7, 2023
+ I finished ["How to Drive a Nuclear Reactor"](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Nuclear-Reactor-Springer-Praxis/dp/3030338754). It describes the systems of a **P**ressurized **W**ater **R**eactor (the most common type) and how a control-room operator starts, manages, and stops it. It's a bit more technical than your standard popsci book, but not as challenging as a textbook. Worth a read if you're interested in nuclear power.
+ [Helion Energy](https://research.contrary.com/reports/helion-energy) is trying to build a 50MW fusion reactor that fits in a shipping container and costs $10M by 2030. Seems wildly optimistic but I look forward to being surprised.

### Feb 6, 2023
+ Over the course of my life, I've noticed that being smart (or being acknowledged as smart) has ascended in importance. But I would say that most people labeled as smart are merely *adept* (skilled within some area of knowledge). I think that [OODA](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/OODA_loop) provides a better framework to judge a person's intelligence by seeing if they can 1) **O**bserve things others don't notice, 2) **O**rient them into an existing set of facts, 3) **D**ecide what to do based on this new knowledge, and 4) actually **A**ct upon their decision. The number of people who can do this in one field, much less many, is *extremely* small. They often don't fit the stereotype of *smart*. And I am not one of them.
+ There's been a lot of talk-talk recently by US "thought leaders" about re-emphasizing manufacturing. [This article](https://danwang.co/definite-optimism-as-human-capital/) beats the same drum, except it's from 2017. So the talk has been going on for a while. Despite things like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (LOL), I'm still waiting to see increases in manufacturing employment. Or lots and lots of robots...
+ [K6](https://k6.io) will generate “virtual users” who continuously run test scenarios defined using Javascript.

### Feb 5, 2023
+ Interesting [blog post by Jay Carlson](https://jaycarlson.net/2023/02/04/the-cheapest-flash-microcontroller-you-can-buy-is-actually-an-arm-cortex-m0/) about a new Cortex-M0+ microcontroller that costs less than 10&#162;.
