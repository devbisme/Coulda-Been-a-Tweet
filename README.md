# Consistency

They say the most important thing in any endeavor is *consistency*. This is where I'll try to write something *every day*. It won't be much, probably just a link or two to something I've read. All the entries will be chronological, with the newest at the top.

+ I finished ["How to Drive a Nuclear Reactor"](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Nuclear-Reactor-Springer-Praxis/dp/3030338754). It describes the systems of a **P**ressurized **W**ater **R**eactor (the most common type) and how a control-room operator starts, manages, and stops it. It's a bit more technical than your standard popsci book, but not as challenging as a textbook. Worth a read if you're interested in nuclear power.

+ Over the course of my life, I've noticed that being smart (or being acknowledged as smart) has ascended in importance. But I would say that most people labeled as smart are merely *adept* (skilled within some area of knowledge). I think that [OODA](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/OODA_loop) provides a better framework to judge a person's intelligence by seeing if they can 1) **O**bserve things others don't notice, 2) **O**rient them into an existing set of facts, 3) **D**ecide what to do based on this new knowledge, and 4) actually **A**ct upon their decision. The number of people who can do this in one field, much less many, is *extremely* small. They often don't fit the stereotype of *smart*. And I am not one of them.
+ There's been a lot of talk-talk recently by US "thought leaders" about re-emphasizing manufacturing. [This article](https://danwang.co/definite-optimism-as-human-capital/) beats the same drum, except it's from 2017. So the talk has been going on for a while. Despite things like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (LOL), I'm still waiting to see increases in manufacturing employment. Or lots and lots of robots...

+ Interesting [blog post by Jay Carlson](https://jaycarlson.net/2023/02/04/the-cheapest-flash-microcontroller-you-can-buy-is-actually-an-arm-cortex-m0/) about a new Cortex-M0+ microcontroller that costs less than 10&#162;.
