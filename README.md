# I Could Have Tweeted This...

Here are things I found interesting and could have put on Twitter, but they're here instead.
All the entries are chronological with the newest at the top.

------------------------------------------
### May 11, 2023
+ An [interesting site](https://chat.lmsys.org/) where you can pick two from a set of LLMs, have a conversation with both, and then select the model you think is best. This results in a [ranking of the LLMs](https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard) by user preference.

------------------------------------------
### May 10, 2023
+ More evidence for vitamin D supplementation: [reduction in all-cause mortality](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/8/1810).
+ Keep up with [the drugs the Cool Software Developers are using](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.01056.pdf): Adderall for debugging and psychedelics for brainstorming.
+ Running agents using LangChain and LLMs is the new hotness, and [HuggingFace has developed a simplified API](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/transformers_agents) for doing this.
+ [Virtual Power Plants](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/virtual-power-plants) are decentralized sources like the batteries in EVs or solar cells on houses that can be flexibly amalgamated to supply power at utility levels. Personally, I'd like a nice nuclear power plant.

------------------------------------------
### May 9, 2023
+ This [Smithsonian story](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/these-intimate-photos-capture-a-family-farms-bittersweet-final-years-180982139/) spends more time on the photographer who's chronicling the final days of an old farm than the elderly farmers who've run it for decades. It's almost like they're an afterthought.
+ I linked to a [prompt engineering guide](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide) several months ago. That's probably hopelessly out of date by now. Here's a [newer one](https://github.com/brexhq/prompt-engineering)
+ If [Pearson sues companies for using their textbooks to train AIs](https://www.standard.co.uk/business/pearson-takes-legal-action-over-use-of-its-content-to-train-ai-b1079807.html), doesn't that mean they can also sue students who learn from these books? If a company just buys a single copy of a textbook and lets the AI read it, they should be good to go, right?

------------------------------------------
### May 8, 2023
+ I discovered this [great site for explanatory articles about machine learning](https://distill.pub/) only to find it went on hiatus in 2021 for the usual reason: it was too much work. The site editors recommend another method that requires much less work (for them): self-publishing.
+ Here's how to [give GPT and other LLMs access to more knowledge](https://sudoapps.substack.com/p/giving-gpt-infinite-knowledge). It's similar to how that guy [built a ChatGPT interface to his quantum biology PhD thesis.](https://www.christophgoetz.com/custom-chat-bot-from-thesis-to-enhance-accessibility/)
+ [Returning to the office could make you a fat drunk](https://nypost.com/2023/05/08/return-to-office-could-make-you-fat-alcoholic-study/), so follow these [common-sense things to keep fat off.](https://primecuts.substack.com/p/the-ten-things-i-do-to-burn-fat-like) Or you can just buy the [latest piece of hyped exercise equipment](https://www.wired.com/story/goruck-sand-kettlebell-rave/) and store it in your closet.
+ This [story](https://www.spytalk.co/p/exclusive-fbi-agents-accuse-cia-of) about the CIA being involved with some of the 9/11 hijackers keeps bubbling up but never seems to get much traction. Probably because so many media organizations now employ ex-CIA people...

------------------------------------------
### May 7, 2023
+ Autoimmune diseases now affect about [10% of the population.](https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_952084_en.html) I wonder how many of those have bacterial or viral causes.
+ This list of [AI Chrome extensions](https://mpost.io/10-best-ai-chrome-extensions-in-2023/) can help you get experience before you lose your job to ChatGPT [like this guy.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/139o1q6/lost_all_my_content_writing_contracts_feeling/)
+ [A ChatGPT interface to make a PhD thesis more understandable to non-experts.](https://www.christophgoetz.com/custom-chat-bot-from-thesis-to-enhance-accessibility/) This is reminiscient of my use of ChatGPT to get an understanding of Mendelian randomization when I found the Wikipedia article too dense.

------------------------------------------
### May 6, 2023
+ Another disease that may be due to bacteria: [Parkinson's.](https://yle.fi/a/74-20030498) On the other hand, [this study](https://theconversation.com/does-our-gut-microbiota-really-influence-our-health-and-life-expectancy-199082) found no causal link between the gut microbiome and chronic diseases. This latter study used a technique called *Mendelian randomization* which I could not understand at all from the [Wikipedia entry](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mendelian_randomization). Luckily, ChatGPT was able to provide a simple example of how it works.
+ All these years I've been incorrectly using the phrase ["comprised of".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Giraffedata/comprised_of)

------------------------------------------
### May 5, 2023
+ Vector databases are used to store and look-up feature values for AI that are translated into single-dimension numeric arrays called *embeddings*. [Here's](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/) the gist of how they work.
+ Google could have taken one of several approaches in response to yesterday's [leaked memo](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither?publication_id=329241&post_id=119223672&isFreemail=true) on how open source developers were out-innovating them in AI. Looks like they decided to [become even more closed.](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-publishing-less-confidential-ai-research-to-compete-with-openai-2023-4)
+ This [article](https://www.city-journal.org/article/public-educations-days-of-reckoning) about declining public school enrollments had one item that surprised me: New York City's schools spend almost $40K per student each year. That seems like a lot.
+ I should never look askance at what others find interesting, but this guy has spent a little too much time [thinking about swings.](https://aeon.co/essays/the-swing-has-a-universal-history-of-transgression)

------------------------------------------
### May 4, 2023
+ [This internal Google doc](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither?publication_id=329241&post_id=119223672&isFreemail=true) is making the rounds today. The basic premise is that open source fine-tuning for specific applications of LLMs is proceeding faster and making greater progress than from-scratch training of large models with massive data sets at Google and OpenAI. Looks like the White House can forget about fencing AI into their public safety corral.
+ As things like agents and AutoGPT take precedence in AI, I see more and more references to LangChain. Here is a [simple re-implementation](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2023/05/04/langchain-mini.html) of it in 100 lines of Javascript.
+ Take a look at the section on interesting projects in this [Python Weekly](https://mailchi.mp/pythonweekly/python-weekly-issue-598?e=f8ee9f6470) and count the number that reference AI, LLMs, or GPT.
+ Just so today's links aren't all about AI: If you've got some free time, maybe you can solve [this mystery](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pasta-new-jersey-mysteriously-dumped-in-old-bridge-woods/).

------------------------------------------
### May 3, 2023
+ Well, the geniuses who brought us the Afghanistan withdrawal are [calling in the chiefs of Google and Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-microsoft-openai-ceos-attend-white-house-ai-meeting-official-2023-05-02/) to make sure AI is only released to the public once it's "safe" (i.e. neutered).
+ [Eighth-graders continue doing poorly in history](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/03/us/us-history-test-scores.html). But don't worry! They'll always be able to query ChatGPT for the facts (once the White House approves a suitably neutered version).
+ Videogame maker [Unity is laying off another 600](https://venturebeat.com/games/unity-lays-off-600-staff-members-prepares-to-close-half-of-its-offices/) in order to "realign some of our resources to better drive focus and support our long-term growth.‚Äù They'll probably be replaced with AI tools similar to [what's happening in China's video game industry](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/chinas-video-game-ai-art-crisis-40x-productivity-spike-70-job-loss).

------------------------------------------
### May 2, 2023
+ [Some opinions of other things going on besides AI:](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35792898) Mostly computer-related, but a bit of other stuff.
+ [Exercise increases your population of tumor-fighting cells.](https://www.utu.fi/en/news/press-release/exercise-increases-the-number-of-cancer-destroying-immune-cells-in-cancer) So be sure to hit those weights after your chemo!
+ [Options for hosting your machine learning models.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35792481)
+ A Transformer was trained on neural waveforms as stories were read to study participants and was then able to [output their thoughts as text](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a3w3g/scientists-use-gpt-ai-to-passively-read-peoples-thoughts-in-breakthrough) based on their neural activations as they heard new stories.

------------------------------------------
### May 1, 2023
+ This would be exciting: [a replacement for the Haber-Bosch process](https://scitechdaily.com/just-add-water-stanford-researchers-have-discovered-a-simple-and-eco-friendly-way-to-make-ammonia/) that can break the bond of atmospheric nitrogen at room temperature and pressure. That would provide an energy-efficient way to make ammonia and then fertilizer. If it scales up that is, which these things seldom do.
+ Another in the endless list of reasons we can't get anything done: [Environmentalists sue the FAA over permits for SpaceX launch.](https://news.yahoo.com/environmentalists-sue-faa-over-spacex-164444196.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9za2ltZmVlZC5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAD3F5uOT7M2mR8vk6O8Zgevz9wCGiilLSr7t75r4QAi2opZLO44x_mBA3TDhrplsGzWdLChNszdBOV_LAvTuulO8fgZoKzojboZTRz2KcYxXLNiRippE1LTcShSj2zZ8dx9k5Fv7gq49ryLXKH46Y1_s0GF4ipuhyY7YdowveoDB) They are requesting "more environmental studies." If these guys had their way, Neil Armstrong would have died as an unknown Navy airman.
+ A timeline of the "inevitable disaster" that is unfolding at Twitter [has been discontinued.](https://twitterisgoinggreat.com/#twitter-has-gone-great) I can only guess it's because Twitter has imploded and shut down, right? So we're all on Mastodon now? Actually, it looks like Twitter outlasted the timeline. Who could have known!?
+ People switching from [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) to start using Python AI libraries like [PyTorch](https://pypi.org/project/torch/) and [fastai](https://pypi.org/project/fastai/) because they can get all the same capabilities plus improvements like automatic gradients and [CUDA interoperability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSEAidM-DDI).

------------------------------------------
### Apr 30, 2023
+ You piss-off one customer for a few hundred dollars and [your whole Ponzi scheme comes down on your head](https://thehustle.co/the-secretary-who-helped-uncover-one-of-americas-strangest-ponzi-schemes/). The kicker: after getting out of jail, he gets convicted a few years later for running another completely unrelated scam. At least he's not a [one-trick pony](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/one-trick%20pony).
+ [Which countries are most online?](https://www.techspot.com/news/98504-study-identifies-which-countries-spend-most-time-starting.html) I was surprised it was South Africa whose population averages 58% of their waking hours looking at screens. And Japan is the lowest at 22%. But, according to [this](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/north-america-holds-top-spot-internet-usage), North America holds the top spot if you rate it by the total percentage of people who have *used* the internet, regardless of for how long.
+ Quite frankly, [ChatGPT operating costs of $700K per day](https://www.techspot.com/news/98422-chatgpt-costs-eye-watering-700000day-operate-claims-new.html) seems pretty reasonable for the impact it's having.
+ We're saved! The G-7 ministers came up with [five principles to govern AI](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2023/04/2fc562a4022c-update1-g-7-ministers-meet-with-ai-risks-digital-infrastructure-in-focus.html). And, yes, they're every bit as unspecific and nebulous as you would expect.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 29, 2023
+ Use [this site](https://www.you-tldr.com/) to get the gist of all those too-long Youtube videos you feel you must watch. But don't get your hopes up that it will generate some super-short video summary. It appears to extract a transcript and an associated summary. (I'm not exactly sure since I accidentally exceeded my free, daily limit of one video.)
+ [Study](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/study-finds-chatgpt-outperforms-physicians-in-high-quality-empathetic-answers-to-patient-questions): "ChatGPT outperforms physicians in high-quality, empathetic answers to patient questions." Certainly a low bar given current healthcare practices...
+ [Another benefit from taking vitamin D](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/7/1765): reducing depression and suicide. Of course, I remember the 80's & 90's when vitamins C & E were also considered wonder supplements.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 28, 2023
+ Well, here's another [crap article](https://decrypt.co/138310/openai-researcher-chance-ai-catastrophe) putting forth unsupported warnings that ChatGPT's children will kill us all. From a guy who heads an AI alignment foundation, of course.
+ How can AI destroy the world if [it's just a waste of time](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/ai-technology-productivity-time-wasting/673880/) because most people are just using it as a toy? Kinda like the internet back when it started...
+ Read about [how the CIA subverted Guatemala's democracy](https://narratively.com/the-literally-unbelievable-story-of-the-original-fake-news-network/) and connect the dots to what's happening today.
+ [New York to ban gas stoves](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/nyregion/gas-stove-ban-ny.html) and [California to ban diesel trucks](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/28/california-bans-the-sale-of-new-diesel-trucks-by-2036.html). Move over Germany, we're breeding our own species of dumb!

------------------------------------------
### Apr 26, 2023
+ [This](https://d-s.sh/2023/mastodon-has-already-won/) will go down as a declaration of premature victory comparable to George Bush's "Mission accomplished!" [Here's](https://justingarrison.com/blog/2023-04-24-mastodon-is-doomed/) the counterpoint.
+ [Colleges remove data science from list of recommended HS math courses.](https://stanforddaily.com/2023/04/25/stanford-harvard-revise-high-school-math-curriculum-recommendations-exclude-data-science/) Of course they're going to remove something that students find fun and practical. *Get back to doing those integrals!* Didn't they learn when they tried to kill off calculators in the 70's?
+ More demographics news: [Japan's population expected to shrink by 1/3 to 87M by 2070](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20230426_23/)
+ [A college degree is worth it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/04/26/college-degree-value-investment-return/) according to ... the President of Princeton. Shocking!

------------------------------------------
### Apr 25, 2023
+ It's hard finding stuff that's not about ChatGPT/AI. [Here's why](https://hn.curiosity.ai/#/trends?terms=AI;ChatGPT)
+ [Congress got forty ChatGPT licenses](https://fedscoop.com/congress-gets-40-chatgpt-plus-licenses/) to start experimenting with the tech before they start regulating the hell out of it. Most probable first questions they ask it: "Where can I find the best child porn?" and "What's the going rate for a Senatorial bribe?"
+ [Left-handers are more vulnerable in a fight](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/15/4/940) which supresses their numbers in a population, but they can still surprise you tactically so they tend not to die out completely.
+ And here's your weekly reminder that [doing space stuff is hard.](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/25/world/lunar-lander-japan-uae-hakuto-r-scn/index.html) Iteration is the norm in this area.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 24, 2023
+ I've started going through the [fast.ai deep learning tutorial](https://course.fast.ai/) in preparation for starting the [Hugging Face course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1). You can accomplish *a lot* in AI without having a solid foundation, but there's no cost for learning the underpinning basics except time.
+ [A comparison of the AI and Industrial Revolutions.](https://streamlife.com/technology/a-tale-of-two-revolutions-how-ai-is-following-in-the-footsteps-of-the-industrial-revolution/) I like these historical compare-and-contrast articles, like this book that examines [the societal impacts of the internet and the telegraph.](https://www.amazon.com/Victorian-Internet-Remarkable-Nineteenth-line/dp/162040592X)
+ ["The Free World Must Stay the Course on Ukraine!"]() How about you just eat me. You may get off by moving little pins around on the geopolitical map, but that doesn't mean the rest of us have to indulge your psychopathic BS.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 23, 2023
+ I just ran across [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html#) as a system for integrating LLMs into applications that do more than just chat. It will be interesting to see how this relates to something like AutoGPT.
+ [Billionaires betting big on fusion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-billionaires-bet-on-fusion-as-holy-grail-for-business-9a48a2ac). Good luck: we've been having trouble even getting fission plants built.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 22, 2023
+ There are lots of Python packages to simplify building GUI interfaces ([PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)) and CLIs ([click](https://pypi.org/project/click/)). Now add [duckargs](https://github.com/eriknyquist/duckargs) which is a program that accepts a description of the arguments for your program and outputs the [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) calls to build the CLI.
+ I use the OpenAI API with [Chatbot-UI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui) for chat-style stuff, but [here's](https://www.makeuseof.com/generate-images-using-openai-api-dalle-python/) how to also use the API for image-generation tasks with DALL-E 2. (Also, here's a [tutorial on CLIP](https://amaarora.github.io/posts/2023-03-06_Understanding_CLIP.html) which is used in DALL-E 2.)
+ Somebody wrote a [Python REPL coupled with ChatGPT](https://isthisit.nz/posts/2023/building-a-chat-gpt-enhanced-python-repl/) to do code development using prompts. And [here](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/spqa-ai-architecture-replace-existing-software/) is another take on how LLMs will change our model of software development.
+ Want to buy fake stars to make your Github project look more impressive? Or suspicious that others are doing that? [There are ways to detect such perfidy!](https://dagster.io/blog/fake-stars)

------------------------------------------
### Apr 21, 2023
+ CATL (world's largest battery manufacturer) [announced](https://thedriven.io/2023/04/21/worlds-largest-battery-maker-announces-major-breakthrough-in-battery-density/) they will start producing a battery *this year* with an energy density of 500 Wh/Kg as compared to the ~285 Wh/Kg of the Tesla 4680 cell. For comparison, gasoline when burned in an internal combustion engine has about 3,000 - 4,000 Wh/Kg.
+ Gosh, you want to build EVs? Well, [Chile just nationalized their lithium industry](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chiles-boric-announces-plan-nationalize-lithium-industry-2023-04-21/) (2nd largest in the world behind Australia). Let's hope this doesn't turn out like when Venezuela nationalized their oil industry...

------------------------------------------
### Apr 20, 2023
+ Well, [SpaceX's Starship ascended 24 miles](https://apnews.com/article/spacex-starship-launch-elon-musk-d9989401e2e07cdfc9753f352e44f6e2) before it had to self-destruct when it became unstable. Good effort, lots of data gathered for the next attempt.
+ Problems of the Future: The Inmarsat-41 satellite went down and Australian farmers were [unable to plant their winter crop.](https://www.smh.com.au/national/farmers-crippled-by-satellite-failure-as-gps-guided-tractors-grind-to-a-halt-20230418-p5d1de.html)
+ And now the AI lawsuits arrive, starting with [Reddit](https://futurism.com/the-byte/reddit-demands-payments-ai-trained), [Tom Brady](https://www.tmz.com/2023/04/20/tom-brady-threatens-lawsuit-over-ai-special-comedians-take-video-down/), and [Michael Schumacher](https://www.reuters.com/sports/motor-sports/schumacher-family-planning-legal-action-over-ai-interview-2023-04-19/).

------------------------------------------
### Apr 19, 2023
+ The problem is, governments write far-reaching laws that have consequences nobody can predict. Today's case in point: the [Python Software Foundation says they may no longer be able to offer access to PyPi to the EU.](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-eus-proposed-cra-law-may-have.html)
+ Have an [LLM translate your word problem into equations](https://ai.papers.bar/paper/7f196b34de4f11edb95839eec3084ddd) and pass those to a symbolic math package for a solution.
+ [A third of "researchers" believe AI could lead to catastrophe](https://fortune.com/2023/04/10/ai-nuclear-level-catastrophe-experts-stanford/) according to the Institute for Human-Centered AI. That's probably the third that is working on AI safety...
+ [Drop a PDF](https://www.chatpdf.com/) and then get answers to questions about it. Seems a bit like [explainpaper.com](https://explainpaper.com).
+ Either believe in dark energy, or be willng to [tweak gravity a bit](https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/modified-theory-of-gravity-eliminates-the-need-for-dark-energy/). Maybe we're at a similar point as when it was thought that light propagation through space required it be filled with "ether" and then the [Michelson-Morley experiment](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment) blew that out of the water.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 18, 2023
+ [High-res MRI scans](https://today.duke.edu/2023/04/brain-images-just-got-64-million-times-sharper) with voxels down to 5 microns in size are now possible. Typical MRIs in clinics have voxels of 1-2 millimeters. Don't expect this at your doctor's, though. The article says one step is to send "the tissue" out for "light sheet microscopy." That sounds like the brain is no longer inside the head...
+ The guy that invented the lithium battery says [we've got a lot of work to do to make it better.](https://spectrum.ieee.org/lithium-ion-battery-disruption-ready)
+ Here's a [list of programming playgrounds](https://github.com/ymyzk/awesome-playgrounds) where you can try various languages in your browser.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 17, 2023
+ The case for [unlocking firmware](https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/17/opinion_column/).
+ Somebody wrote a little [Python script to flesh-out links in their posts](https://animaomnium.github.io/keep-stuff-linkable/). Quite frankly, I think authors lean on links a bit *too much*. Instead of providing a pithy summary of something to support their argument, they just link to some external page and say "So there!" Then you have to descend into that link, read it, parse how it relates to what you were reading, and then pop back up to the original article where you'll soon encounter *another link*. It's exhausting.
+ I wrote a [forum post](https://forum.kicad.info/t/ai-artificial-intelligence/40642/57?u=devbisme) on using GPT4 to create part symbols for KiCad.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 16, 2023
+ I've always liked the idea of [constraint programming](https://mareknarozniak.com/2020/06/22/constraint-programming/): Set up the constraints and then let the computer figure out the answer. My problem has always been with learning the syntax of the various libraries. I have a similar problem with `matplotlib`, but then I used ChatGPT to iteratively evolve a graph showing per-capital GDPs for a set of countries. Maybe I can do the same thing for constraint programming libraries?
+ AI algorithm designers won't settle down enough to let AI chip designers [sleep at night](https://semiengineering.com/nightmare-fuel-the-hazards-of-ml-hardware-accelerators/).
+ [Financial software meets LLMs](https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/04/13/where-financial-models-meet-large-language-models/): It's like a match made in heaven. That is, if you consider Frankenstein getting up with Voltron a heavenly match...
+ People are freaking out about stuff, but [people have always freaked out about stuff](https://medium.com/grimhistorian/8-inventions-that-once-freaked-people-out-way-more-than-a-i-27e703a52b90).

------------------------------------------
### Apr 15, 2023
+ [How to run AutoGPT](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/auto-gpt-ai-agent): Now you can just set up your tasks and let ChatGPT go to work on them. All you've got to do is say "Yep, keep going" every once and a while until they're all done.
+ [Starship orbital flight test](https://everydayastronaut.com/starship-superheavy-orbital-flight-test/) scheduled for April 17th!
+ [Something out there is really bright!](https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/bizarre-object-10-million-times-brighter-than-the-sun-defies-physics-nasa-says) Must be a neutron star surpassing the [Eddington Limit](https://www.britannica.com/science/Eddington-mass-limit) which was calculated by a guy who had a [TV movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995036/) made about him and Einstein. There, now your day has not been wasted...

------------------------------------------
### Apr 14, 2023
+ An interesting [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92E7YRgBIGs) with sci-fi author David Brin.
+ [WikiBinge](https://www.wikibinge.com/) attempts to show a "vague" connection between any two items you enter into their form. I was hoping it would generate something akin to a mini-version of a [James Burke "Connections"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078588/) episode. Unfortunately, it just lists a chain of articles that are related, usually by having some words in common. Seems like this could now be done much better with GPT...
+ I don't agree with the [AI Pause letter](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/). [This](https://www.oreilly.com/content/you-cant-regulate-what-you-dont-understand-2/) seems like a better alternative since much of the direction would come from within the AI industry itself. Even so, I'm sure government will try some ham-fisted regulation and we'll end up with the AI version of the NRC: No nukes **and** no AI for you!

------------------------------------------
### Apr 13, 2023
+ There's a Youtube series focusing on AI hardware and here's the [first episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQzf_1AkNXw).
+ In the debate about AI's affect on the workforce, here's a [datapoint](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/chinas-video-game-ai-art-crisis-40x-productivity-spike-70-job-loss): a 70% reduction in job postings for Chinese videogame illustrators with a 40x gain in productivity. Of course, some customers complain about in-game characters with too many fingers or missing legs...
+ [Germany's economy is suffering](https://www.apricitas.io/p/germanys-slowdown), partly from energy deficits. Households and companies have had to cut energy use by 18% and they're still gonna shutter their last three nukes. Sheesh!
+ Looks like that murder of the tech entrepreneur in SF [might not have been random violence](https://missionlocal.org/2023/04/bob-lee-killing-arrest-made-san-francisco/) after all. And score one for SF police: they actually arrested somebody!
+ A [study across five divergent species](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01040-x) exposed a common link that affects aging: DNA-to-RNA transcription becomes faster and more error-prone as we age.

### Apr 12, 2023
+ Here's another awesome compendium, this time of [decentralized LLMs](https://github.com/imaurer/awesome-decentralized-llm) that you can "own".
+ Looks like NPR went extreme pouty face, took their ball, and [went home](https://www.wbur.org/npr/1169269161/npr-leaves-twitter-government-funded-media-label). Now where will I go on Twitter for all the race and gender news that's fit to spew?
+ Taiwan says [no need to destroy TSMC](https://www.techspot.com/news/96291-taiwan-destroying-tsmc-event-chinese-invasion-unnecessary.html) if China invades. With the crazy assholes in-charge in Washington, I'm surprised they haven't bombed the chip fabs already. Anybody who thinks they know the results of doing that is not aware of [what can happen when you ignore ecosystem effects.](https://www.historydefined.net/how-killing-sparrows-led-to-one-of-the-greatest-famines-in-history/)
+ To save the planet, [Germany has decided to close its last three nuclear plants](https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/04/11/germany-turns-its-back-on-nuclear-for-good-despite-europes-energy-crisis) and burn more gas and coal. The thinking is they don't need 'em since they made it through the winter just fine. In related news, Germany was awarded the "Short-Sighted Dumbass of the Year Award" for 2023. Yeah, the whole country.

+ Here's a pragmatic explanation of [how to remember things using spaced repetition.](https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition#vect)
+ If you have an OpenAI API token, then you can run [chatbot-ui](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui) locally to get the same experience as using ChatGPT via the web browser version. (The advantage of the API is you are charged on a per-usage basis instead of a flat $20/month.)
+ Well, you knew it was coming: [Awesome ChatGPT](https://github.com/eon01/awesome-chatgpt).

Now the Euros want an [open-source, CERN-like recreation of Open AI](https://www.openpetition.eu/petition/online/securing-our-digital-future-a-cern-for-open-source-large-scale-ai-research-and-its-safety), but they'll probably strangle it in the cradle over safety concerns.
+ Positive movements in the West: [the US is building more factories](https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-manufacturing-factory-jobs-comeback-3ce0c52c) and [the UK is making them more flexible with 3D printing](https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/mod-teams-up-with-industry-for-3d-printing/).

### Apr 8, 2023
+ Antmicro [announced](https://antmicro.com/blog/2023/04/open-hardware-portal/) an [open hardware portal](https://openhardware.antmicro.com/) and a design flow that makes it easy to take circuit board Gerber files and a BOM and create realistic 3D renders using Blender.
+ How human societies evolved in two parts. [Part 1](https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/violent-enough-to-stand-still) discusses early societies where men killed each other to gain access to women who were largely self-sufficient due to adequate resources. In [part 2](https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/why-do-humans-ever-develop?sd=pf), population pressures required more male involvement in agricultural food production, thus making workers more important than warriors and leading to societies with fewer wars.

+ If you're into cybersecurity, then here's a [site](https://clark.center/browse?collection=nccp&currPage=1) with hundreds of *free* classes, including some from the NSA. It's security-focused, but it also includes modules on programming, quantum computing, and reverse engineering.
+ So far this week, San Francisco has killed a [software entrepreneur](https://nypost.com/2023/04/06/bystander-ignored-dying-tech-guru-bob-lee-begging-for-help/) and the [USA cycling champion](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/usa-cycling-champion-dies-struck-driver-presidio-17883293.php). Unfortunately, Mayor Breed may need more high-profile deaths before she'll help SF clean up its act.
+ [Good sources](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35479853) to keep up with AI. Yeah, well, good luck with that...
+ [NPR won't tweet](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/04/npr-says-it-wont-tweet-from-npr-until-twitter-removes-false-state-affiliated-label/) until Twitter stops calling it "state-affiliated media". That sounds pretty OK since NPR tweets like they're state-affiliated media.

### Apr 6, 2023
+ There's something about the EU and technology, in that [they want none of it.](https://stealthoptional.com/news/italys-chatgpt-ban-spreads-to-france-germany-and-ireland/) I don't know how this works out well for them.

I'm getting visions of that freaky Escher print where there's a hand drawing another hand that's drawing the first hand...
+ Somebody else had GPT4 generate an [abbreviated language to cut down on the number of tokens needed in the context buffer.](https://twitter.com/VictorTaelin/status/1642664054912155648) Won't be long before GPT4 is talking to itself in a language we can't understand.

+ The BRICS countries now have a [greater share of GDP than the West](https://www.silkroadbriefing.com/news/2023/03/27/the-brics-has-overtaken-the-g7-in-global-gdp/) and they are also [developing their own reserve currency.](https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-03-31/Ditch-the-dollar-movement-grows-as-Moscow-calls-for-the-creation-of-a-common-BRICS-currency.html) The only viable avenue open for the West is to out-innovate them, but that seems unlikely given the political leadership of the past few decades. So expect to see a lot more bombing...

### Mar 30, 2023
+ [Getting power from blood sugar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/126icbf/researchers_develop_breakthrough_technology_to/): Maybe this can be used to power biological nanomachines, but the prototype looks like something I taped together from my kitchen junk drawer.

Alarm bells should go off when you see one of the AI pitfalls they're trying to avoid is "political disruptions (especially to democracy)".

+ The [problem with stuff like Clearview](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/124jkxo/clearview_ai_used_nearly_1m_times_by_us_police_it/) is the police use it a few times and catch some bad guys, and then they say "If we used it *more*, we could do even *more* good!" That's when things go bad and you end up with some cop scanning randos looking for his ex-GF going into Hunk-O-Mania.

(Incidently, since the grade of copper ore has fallen from 50% copper to 0.5%, the best place to mine it is sometimes in the tailings of old mines. The stuff they threw away back then is better than what we can mine right now.)

+ Whenever buying a car is discussed, my wife always gravitates to expensive cars with loads of safety features. My response: "You want safety? Don't use a cell phone while the car's moving. Boom! [You're safer than 77% of the drivers out there](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-03-14/deaths-broken-limbs-distracted-driving) and it costs nothing. Now, how about that [Fiero](https://www.motor1.com/news/132346/worst-sports-cars-pontiac-fiero/)?"
+ Around 1980, society started shifting from a collective to an individualistic viewpoint according to an [analysis of the language used in millions of books](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/940009). It will be interesting to see if this starts to shift back given the emphasis on acting for the collective good by some segments of the population during the COVID crisis.
+ [Terrifying plastic rocks](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/brazilian-researchers-find-terrifying-plastic-rocks-remote-island-2023-03-15/) are evidence of how our profligate consumerism is destroying the environment.

+ I've always been interested in the [Demoscene](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Demoscene) and how their members are able to get such striking visuals and animations from so little code. Here's an example of a [jellyfish animation](https://www.geeks3d.com/hacklab/20210902/jellyfish-tweet-shader/) that fits in a single tweet.

+ Here's a list of [interesting publishers in the tech world](https://arbesman.net/publishing).
+ Multimodal models that operate on several types of input data (text, image, etc.) are now heating up. [Here's one from NVIDIA labs](https://shikun.io/projects/prismer) that's completely [open-sourced](https://github.com/NVlabs/prismer). Makes sense since NVIDIA's money comes from hardware and they would benefit by having their model widely used.

+ Brush your teeth so you don't [die of a heart attack](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-023-5507-4). Also, mouthwash kills bacteria that [help to lower blood pressure](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/09/190903111242.htm). So what the hell...

------------------------------------------
### Mar 6, 2023
+ This [Quora answer](https://qr.ae/prcjEt) demonstrates how doing something different from everyone else can give you a marked leg-up in a competition (in this case, shooting down airplanes). It's similar to the success a football coach had when he decided to [flip the 70%-30% ratio of run-versus-pass plays to 30%-70%](https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Pass-American-Reinvention-Football/dp/1501116193).
+ Of course, doing something different doesn't always lead to success. [This paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228178742_Pioneer_Advantage_Marketing_Logic_or_Marketing_Legend) shows that first entrants  ("pioneers") only capture 10% of a new market and seldom maintain their leadership over a later entrant that gains 28% of the market.

+ There is now a [tufte.css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) for formatting your HTML articles in the clear, minimalistic style of Edward Tufte. Although not the main focus, [Tufte-LaTeX](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/) is also mentioned.

+ Looks like someone was able to [reconstruct the images being viewed](https://github.com/yu-takagi/StableDiffusionReconstruction) by feeding fMRI scan data from the language and visual areas of a brain into a Stable Diffusion model.
+ Somebody submitted a [PR to Meta's LLaMa Github repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/pull/73/files) with a link to a torrent of the model weights. (Normally, Meta wants you to submit a form to get access to those.)

At one point, it discusses the construction of the Empire State building which was done in about 12 months from start to finish. This [blog post](https://constructionphysics.substack.com/p/construction-productivity-structural) contrasts that project with the building of the World Trade Center and shows that the workers on the Empire State building were 2x - 4x more productive. And [this blog post](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-build-nothing-country?publication_id=35345&post_id=105353895&isFreemail=true) bemoans the fact that America can't seem to build *anything*.

+ If I ever got around to making a game, I'd look seriously at [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot). It's getting to that Blender level of critical mass.
+ The AI LLM of the day is ... [KOSMOS-1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14045.pdf)! This one works with different types of data (text & images) and can do things like explain what's going on in a picture or understand the text in an image without using OCR.
+ OpenAI has released [APIs to ChatGPT and Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis). In addition, there is an upcoming [ChatML](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/chatml.md) format that lets you interact with GPT models using JSON-formatted data. 
+ Operating at a lower level than things like GPT, [JAX](https://colinraffel.com/blog/you-don-t-know-jax.html) augments Pyton's `numpy` to make it easier to perform machine learning operations.

### Feb 23, 2023
+ I pointed to [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) a few days ago and now here's a [Mermaid cheatsheet](https://jojozhuang.github.io/tutorial/mermaid-cheat-sheet/) for doing similar text-based graphics within a Markdown file. All these things seem to rely on the remarkably long-lived [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) tool.

------------------------------------------
### Feb 22, 2023
+ Looks like we have another web-based PCB design suite: [Flux](https://docs.flux.ai/). Your design is stored in their central database and I'm not sure if you can export your design files. So what happens if the company ceases to exist or if the server is just down?
+ [Lots of interest in demographics](https://stenoresearch.com/watch-series/introducing-the-problem-index-which-countries-have-the-worst-demographics/) since the developed/developing world has a problem keeping their birthrates above replacement level. Check out the [South Korean birthrate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-22/south-korea-fertility-rate-falls-again-adding-to-economic-risks).

------------------------------------------
### Feb 19, 2023
+ Somewhere on my travels through ChatGPT-land, I ran across [Colossal-AI](https://www.hpc-ai.tech/blog/colossal-ai-chatgpt), a FOSS toolkit for replicating ChatGPT using fewer compute resources (i.e., GPUs) and with faster training. I'm not expert enough and haven't tried it to see if that's true or just BS. But it's open source so you can look for yourself.
+ If you're into making animated visualizations in the browser, [SwissGL](https://github.com/google/swissgl) is a minimalistic wrapper on top of the WebGL2 JS API. This looks like a quick way to get GPU-assisted visualizations onto the web.
+ [What will soda cans look like in forty years?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/116f83f/given_how_soda_cans_have_changed_over_the_years/)

### Feb 18, 2023
+ I was reading this [article](https://aruva.medium.com/using-chatgpt-to-build-system-diagrams-part-i-69efc7603926) about using ChatGPT to create system modeling diagrams by having it output markdown containing Mermaid (which is amazing by itself). But this led me to the FOSS tool [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) that lets you generate many types of diagrams from a text description: UML, mindmaps, mathematics, etc. Using ChatGPT to drive text-based tools like these with natural language inputs gives them capabilities that aren't readily available in GUI-based tools.
+ Interesting [article](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/16/ukraine-russia-war-drone-warfare-china/) about how both Ukraine and Russia are somewhat dependent upon drones from a private company ([DJI](https://www.dji.com/)) in China. DJI has applied geofencing to restrict the use of their drones in wars in the Middle East, but not in Ukraine (so far).

### Feb 17, 2023
+ Meta is handing out a lot of [negative reviews to its workers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/og-mark-returns-at-meta-as-facebook-parent-gives-thousands-of-staff-subpar-reviews-56e648b4). It also wants to [solve the noise problem](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-metas-push-to-solve-the-noisy-office-ba43042) in its offices. I guess having fewer employees would be one way to do that...
+ This [article](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/) covers how ChatGPT works. Along the way, it talks about models, neural nets, training, embeddings, semantics, etc. I haven't read it in detail, but I plan to. Better than reading WSJ articles about Meta...

### Feb 16, 2023
+ I use [PySpice](https://pypi.org/project/PySpice/) as a Python interface to ngspice to provide circuit simulation capabilities in [SKiDL](https://github.com/devbisme/skidl). Now there's a fork called [OpenSPICE](https://github.com/thejackal360/OpenSPICE) that adds a native Python simulator. There's not a lot of documentation I could find outside of [this article](https://hackaday.com/2023/02/14/openspice-a-portable-python-circuit-simulator/). In the comments, there's also a link to [PyLTSpice](https://pypi.org/project/PyLTSpice/) which lets you drive LTSpice through a Python interface.

### Feb 15, 2023
+ I've always been interested in forecasting, even though I suck at it. [Superforecasting](https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock-ebook/dp/B00RKO6MS8) is a great book on how to make better predictions of the future, and [this article](https://www.arcdigital.media/p/superforecasters-in-the-cosmic-bazaar?r=lle6p) is a good, broad-brush exposition of the principles.
+ I frequently use the website [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) to get rid of backgrounds in images I want to use as clip-art. I just ran across the [rembg](https://pypi.org/project/rembg/#description) Python package that does the same thing locally, and the code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg).

If so, [this *extensive* visual guide to Pandas](https://betterprogramming.pub/pandas-illustrated-the-definitive-visual-guide-to-pandas-c31fa921a43) may be for you. (Note: This is hosted on Medium so you may be able to view it or you may not. Who knows...) And if actually learning how it works is too much, there's a Python package called [sketch](https://pypi.org/project/sketch/) that uses AI to assist you in using Pandas.

+ Japan is going [full bore on nuclear](https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/business/companies/20230210-90175/). Looks like the government will be paying for their share of the build-out by charging "carbon fees" to companies using fossil fuels.
+ Looks like Intel Foundry service [isn't going to be directly supporting RISC-V](https://www.electropages.com/blog/2023/01/intel-terminates-risc-v-development-project-what-happened).

+ You can get a lot of prepackaged Docker containers for FOSS EDA tools [here](https://hdl.github.io/containers/). [This page](https://hdl.github.io/containers/ToolsAndImages.html) lists the available tools. Most of these are HDL/FPGA/VLSI design tools so don't expect to get containers for things like KiCad and FreeCAD.
+ A while ago, I built a [Docker container for KiCad](https://github.com/devbisme/docker_kicad5). It's for version 5, but it should be easy to modify it for versions 6 and 7 (when it becomes available).

+ [Here's](https://www.hackster.io/news/one-man-s-trash-is-another-man-s-compute-cluster-b6735c5d8385) the latest effort to repurpose old smartphones into a compute cluster. Unfortunately, the phones are loaded with the [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubuntu-touch.io/) linux variant and that isn't supported on any of the old phones I have lieing around.
+ A couple of pro-nuke articles about [uninformed fears of nuclear waste](https://zionlights.substack.com/p/everything-i-believed-about-waste-was-wrong) and [the nuclear renaissance](https://quillette.com/2023/02/09/the-dawn-of-nuclear-energy-abundance/).

+ Instead of [running Doom on a soldering iron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCC941xKuBs), it seems the new trend is to implement ChatGPT in as few lines as possible. [Here's one](https://jaykmody.com/blog/gpt-from-scratch/) that does it in 60 lines of NumPy.

+ Last week, America was incensed that [a Chinese spy ballon traversed our airspace](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-briefed-40-nations-china-spy-balloon-incident-diplomats-official-say-2023-02-08/). This week, we learned that [we blew up Russia's Nordstream gas supply lines](https://seymourhersh.substack.com/p/how-america-took-out-the-nord-stream?r=5mz1)...

+ I finished ["How to Drive a Nuclear Reactor"](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Nuclear-Reactor-Springer-Praxis/dp/3030338754). It describes the systems of a **P**ressurized **W**ater **R**eactor (the most common type) and how a control-room operator starts, manages, and stops it. It's a bit more technical than your standard popsci book, but not as challenging as a textbook. Worth a read if you're interested in nuclear power.
+ [Helion Energy](https://research.contrary.com/reports/helion-energy) is trying to build a 50MW fusion reactor that fits in a shipping container and costs $10M by 2030. Seems wildly optimistic but I look forward to being surprised.

+ Over the course of my life, I've noticed that being smart (or being acknowledged as smart) has ascended in importance. But I would say that most people labeled as smart are merely *adept* (skilled within some area of knowledge). I think that [OODA](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/OODA_loop) provides a better framework to judge a person's intelligence by seeing if they can 1) **O**bserve things others don't notice, 2) **O**rient them into an existing set of facts, 3) **D**ecide what to do based on this new knowledge, and 4) actually **A**ct upon their decision. The number of people who can do this in one field, much less many, is *extremely* small. They often don't fit the stereotype of *smart*. And I am not one of them.
+ There's been a lot of talk-talk recently by US "thought leaders" about re-emphasizing manufacturing. [This article](https://danwang.co/definite-optimism-as-human-capital/) beats the same drum, except it's from 2017. So the talk has been going on for a while. Despite things like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (LOL), I'm still waiting to see increases in manufacturing employment. Or lots and lots of robots...

+ Interesting [blog post by Jay Carlson](https://jaycarlson.net/2023/02/04/the-cheapest-flash-microcontroller-you-can-buy-is-actually-an-arm-cortex-m0/) about a new Cortex-M0+ microcontroller that costs less than 10&#162;.
