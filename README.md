# I Could Have Tweeted This...

Here are things I found interesting and could have put on Twitter, but they're here instead.
All the entries are chronological with the newest at the top.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 11, 2023
+ Here's another awesome compendium, this time of [decentralized LLMs](https://github.com/imaurer/awesome-decentralized-llm) that you can "own".
+ Looks like NPR went extreme pouty face, took their ball, and [went home](https://www.wbur.org/npr/1169269161/npr-leaves-twitter-government-funded-media-label). Now where will I go on Twitter for all the race and gender news that's fit to spew?

------------------------------------------
### Apr 11, 2023
+ Here's [67 birthday bromides](https://github.com/devbisme/birthday_bromides) for your edification.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 10, 2023
+ Here's a pragmatic explanation of [how to remember things using spaced repetition.](https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition#vect)
+ If you have an OpenAI API token, then you can run [chatbot-ui](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui) locally to get the same experience as using ChatGPT via the web browser version. (The advantage of the API is you are charged on a per-usage basis instead of a flat $20/month.)
+ Well, you knew it was coming: [Awesome ChatGPT](https://github.com/eon01/awesome-chatgpt).

------------------------------------------
### Apr 9, 2023
+ [We got a bevy open source LLMs due to a single leak](https://thesequence.substack.com/i/113372037/editorial-the-llama-effect-how-an-accidental-leak-sparked-a-series-of-impressive-open-source-alternatives-to-chatgpt). (Thanks, 4chan! Guess you're not just a meme machine.) Now the Euros want an [open-source, CERN-like recreation of Open AI](https://www.openpetition.eu/petition/online/securing-our-digital-future-a-cern-for-open-source-large-scale-ai-research-and-its-safety), but they'll probably strangle it in the cradle over safety concerns.
+ Positive movements in the West: [the US is building more factories](https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-manufacturing-factory-jobs-comeback-3ce0c52c) and [the UK is making them more flexible with 3D printing](https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/mod-teams-up-with-industry-for-3d-printing/).
+ Engineers seem to like categorizing themselves. You're either [Type 1 or Type 2](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/two-types-of-software-engineers), or a [martial artist or a street fighter](https://ravitejakanta.substack.com/p/the-2-breeds-of-10x-engineers). Couldn't care less...
+ Meanwhile, mathematicians have derived [a formula for achieving orgasm.](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/mps/internal/newsandevents?id=60611) Way to bring the magic to the bedroom, guys!

------------------------------------------
### Apr 8, 2023
+ Antmicro [announced](https://antmicro.com/blog/2023/04/open-hardware-portal/) an [open hardware portal](https://openhardware.antmicro.com/) and a design flow that makes it easy to take circuit board Gerber files and a BOM and create realistic 3D renders using Blender.
+ How human societies evolved in two parts. [Part 1](https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/violent-enough-to-stand-still) discusses early societies where men killed each other to gain access to women who were largely self-sufficient due to adequate resources. In [part 2](https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/why-do-humans-ever-develop?sd=pf), population pressures required more male involvement in agricultural food production, thus making workers more important than warriors and leading to societies with fewer wars.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 7, 2023
+ Doesn't look like all the links to papers are active yet, but here's the [Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Open-Source Design Automation (OSDA), 2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2303.18024).
+ If you're into cybersecurity, then here's a [site](https://clark.center/browse?collection=nccp&currPage=1) with hundreds of *free* classes, including some from the NSA. It's security-focused, but it also includes modules on programming, quantum computing, and reverse engineering.
+ So far this week, San Francisco has killed a [software entrepreneur](https://nypost.com/2023/04/06/bystander-ignored-dying-tech-guru-bob-lee-begging-for-help/) and the [USA cycling champion](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/usa-cycling-champion-dies-struck-driver-presidio-17883293.php). Unfortunately, Mayor Breed may need more high-profile deaths before she'll help SF clean up its act.
+ [Good sources](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35479853) to keep up with AI. Yeah, well, good luck with that...
+ [NPR won't tweet](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/04/npr-says-it-wont-tweet-from-npr-until-twitter-removes-false-state-affiliated-label/) until Twitter stops calling it "state-affiliated media". That sounds pretty OK since NPR tweets like they're state-affiliated media.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 6, 2023
+ There's something about the EU and technology, in that [they want none of it.](https://stealthoptional.com/news/italys-chatgpt-ban-spreads-to-france-germany-and-ireland/) I don't know how this works out well for them.
+ At least [the French are mad at something](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/06/business/blackrock-office-stormed-paris-protests/index.html) in addition to tech. Like rich people.
+ AI revolutionizing the workplace? [It's going to take longer than you think.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12cr1gb/the_real_world_moves_slower_than_you_think_a_case/)
+ [Five times science got it wrong.](https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/5-times-that-science-got-it-wrong) Really? Only five? (But it's a good thing when science self-corrects rather than circling the wagons and chanting "Believe Science".)

------------------------------------------
### Apr 5, 2023
+ Been putting off using brain-machine interfaces because of that nasty conductive gel or, you know, *brain surgery*? Well then, you're gonna love these [graphene-based sensors](https://spectrum.ieee.org/brain-machine-interface-dry-sensor)!
+ Meta [open-sourced a new image-segmentation AI model](https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1643647849824161792) that even works on objects it's never seen before.
+ The predicted dates for Twitter's downfall have all passed and now [people are getting a bit sick of Mastodon.](https://andy-bell.co.uk/i-think-im-not-alone-that-mastodon-is-giving-me-the-ick/)
+ Finally, something from ... *me!* I wrote a small script to use GPT to make news articles more delicious and nutritious by removing bias: [nutrinews](https://pypi.org/project/nutrinews/).

------------------------------------------
### Apr 4, 2023
+ Oh, well, looks like [some people just can't be happy.](https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/ipcc-report-climate-optimism/)
+ [Improve children's diet by extending dinnertime by 10 minutes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/12bzhvi/increasing_family_mealtime_duration_by/) This is new? My parents would make me sit at the table for *hours* until I finished my meat.
+ They identified the network leading [from a pleasurable physical touch to the brain's reward center.](https://www.drugdiscoverynews.com/how-the-brain-rewards-pleasurable-physical-touch-15648) Can't wait for the drug companies to monetize *that*.
+ [Call centers are embracing AI.](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/feature/AI-takes-center-stage-in-the-future-of-contact-centers) I look forward to being informed about my expiring car warranty by GPT4...
+ Will we be creating any new [boilerplate templates](https://github.com/melvin0008/awesome-projects-boilerplates#readme) in the future, or is that just part of the gone-away world after AI?
------------------------------------------
### Apr 3, 2023
+ The West takes another beating: When faced with a choice between supporting American hegemony and having energy for its people, looks like [Japan has opted for that sweet, sweet Russian crude...](https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-breaks-with-u-s-allies-buys-russian-oil-at-prices-above-cap-1395accb)
+ An interesting effort: use GPT4 to help develop [a pseudocode language that can be used to describe algorithms to GPT4](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/sudolang-a-powerful-pseudocode-programming-language-for-llms-d64d42aa719b) so it can write the detailed version. I'm getting visions of that freaky Escher print where there's a hand drawing another hand that's drawing the first hand...
+ Somebody else had GPT4 generate an [abbreviated language to cut down on the number of tokens needed in the context buffer.](https://twitter.com/VictorTaelin/status/1642664054912155648) Won't be long before GPT4 is talking to itself in a language we can't understand. Then Peggy Noonan can say ["Told ya so!"](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-six-month-ai-pause-no-longer-is-needed-civilization-danger-chat-gpt-chatbot-internet-big-tech-4b66da6e)
+ With the onslaught of AI developments lately, we lose sight of all the improvements still being made to our software infrastructure. [Here's to you, Pandas, with your new 2.0 release!](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

------------------------------------------
### Apr 2, 2023
+ GPT4 produces better results when prompted to "show its steps", but does even better when [asked to critique itself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SgJKZLBrmg)
+ They keep telling the West to get stuffed: [OPEC+ does surprise oil cut.](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sarabia-other-opec-producers-announce-voluntary-oil-output-cuts-2023-04-02/)
+ [Twitter downranks pro-Ukraine tweets.](https://english.nv.ua/nation/analysis-of-code-for-twitter-algorithm-reveals-social-medium-down-ranks-tweets-about-ukraine-50314963.html) Meanwhile, [everybody else upranks them.](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/28/1159712623/how-russia-is-losing-and-winning-the-information-war-in-ukraine) I'm calling it a wash...
+ [Generative graphics with Rust](https://sarpex.com/2021/08/creative-programming-with-nannou/): Might be a good way to introduce myself to the language.

------------------------------------------
### Apr 1, 2023
+ What good is an AI if it doesn't have neat stuff to use like [drone aircraft that autonomously refuel](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/airbuss-autonomous-drone-refueling-demo-echoes-need-thats-set-to-rapidly-expand) and [zippy little drone boats with Stinger missiles](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/stinger-missile-toting-drone-boats-could-protect-navy-logistics-ships)?
+ Here's a list of [web apps that don't require a login.](https://github.com/aviaryan/awesome-no-login-web-apps#programming-tools)
+ James Watt founded a British IP company almost two centuries before ARM. He ran his business not by building steam engines but from [licensing others to build them](https://antonhowes.substack.com/p/age-of-invention-the-first-intangibles?publication_id=18480&post_id=111654983&isFreemail=true) and then charging a royalty based on the cost of the coal that was saved over using a less efficient design.

------------------------------------------
### Mar 31, 2023
+ The BRICS countries now have a [greater share of GDP than the West](https://www.silkroadbriefing.com/news/2023/03/27/the-brics-has-overtaken-the-g7-in-global-gdp/) and they are also [developing their own reserve currency.](https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-03-31/Ditch-the-dollar-movement-grows-as-Moscow-calls-for-the-creation-of-a-common-BRICS-currency.html) The only viable avenue open for the West is to out-innovate them, but that seems unlikely given the political leadership of the past few decades. So expect to see a lot more bombing...
+ Out-innovating the BRICS becomes even less likely when we [remove algebra from the 8th grade...](https://www.sfexaminer.com/forum/put-algebra-1-back-in-eighth-grade/article_01ca608e-be01-11ed-9d12-5fb4111a4db8.html)
+ When Western goverments [prosecute small Twitter accounts for "election interference"](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/social-media-influencer-douglass-mackey-convicted-election-interference-2016) and [outlaw ChatGPT](https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1641767348347584514) because it spews "misinformation", then you know the West has completely lost the plot...
+ OK, something at least a little bit technical: [Using LLMs to control the coordinated operation of other AI models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580)

------------------------------------------
### Mar 30, 2023
+ [Getting power from blood sugar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/126icbf/researchers_develop_breakthrough_technology_to/): Maybe this can be used to power biological nanomachines, but the prototype looks like something I taped together from my kitchen junk drawer.
+ Cerebras - the company that makes gazillion-transistor AI wafers - has open sourced the [GPT-3 model architecture as well as model training data, weights and checkpoints.](https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/03/29/cerebras-smashes-ai-wide-open-countering-hypocrites/)
+ I remember using [APL](https://medium.com/@kaleberg7/apl-an-array-oriented-programming-language-b03fb39401c1) back in 1979. You needed a special terminal with Greek letters and other strange symbols on it, or else use a regular terminal and memorize which keys corresponded to those wacky symbols.
+ [Why do sharks attack humans?](https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/why-do-sharks-attack-humans) Because we taste good. Don't tell the aliens.

------------------------------------------
### Mar 29, 2023
+ Well, now we've got an [open letter urging a six-month pause in training of LLMs](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/). Alarm bells should go off when you see one of the AI pitfalls they're trying to avoid is "political disruptions (especially to democracy)". The dis/mis/malinformation crowd has found a new horse to ride...
+ Good luck reigning in AI models (and this is just today): [OpenFlamingo](https://laion.ai/blog/open-flamingo/), [gpt4all](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all)
+ We may be overstating the [draconian penalties of the RESTRICT Act](https://beincrypto.com/vpn-users-risk-20-year-jail-sentences-us-restrict-act/), but then again, our government did get up to some diabolical shit under the guise of the PATRIOT Act.

------------------------------------------
### Mar 28, 2023
+ The [problem with stuff like Clearview](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/124jkxo/clearview_ai_used_nearly_1m_times_by_us_police_it/) is the police use it a few times and catch some bad guys, and then they say "If we used it *more*, we could do even *more* good!" That's when things go bad and you end up with some cop scanning randos looking for his ex-GF going into Hunk-O-Mania.
+ People have enough subscriptions and [they don't want them for cars.](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/124nwjw/consumers_arent_buying_automaker_plans_to_make/) I just want to put a key into it and go off somewhere nobody can find me. I don't even want power windows. Hell, I don't even care if I have to stop it by dragging my foot on the pavement...
+ More AI-based chip placement, this time from [NVIDIA](https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/03/27/the-dream-of-placing-blocks-on-chip-designs-with-ai/).
+ [A 294-page book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW38DDBK?&linkCode=sl1&tag=bfilipek-20&linkId=76ab48a6d53fca53c8b00a8515d531c9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) that covers ... C++ *initialization*. That's it, that's the whole book. C++ has become a language that revels in its own complexity.

------------------------------------------
### Mar 27, 2023
+ Google solved [chip component placement using deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w) in 2021, or [maybe not...](https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/27/google_ai_chip_paper_nature/)
+ That new world order just [keeps getting reordered...](https://www.dw.com/en/a-new-world-order-brics-nations-provide-an-alternative-to-the-west/a-65124269)
+ Remember how we were supposed to be scared stiff that the world would have 10B people on it this century? Yeah, well you can [just forget about that.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/world-population-bomb-may-never-go-off-as-feared-finds-study) But still be scared, of course. Our leaders can't let us off the hook that easy.

------------------------------------------
### Mar 26, 2023
+ NVIDIA has developed a GPU library to give a [40x speed-up to the computation of photomask patterns](https://spectrum.ieee.org/inverse-lithography) for making advanced chips like GPUs ...
+ Skip the browser and run ChatGPT right from the command line using [Chatblade](https://github.com/npiv/chatblade) or [gptcli](https://github.com/evilpan/gptcli).
+ In keeping with my interest in atoms (versus bits), here's something on [mine tailings](https://bfrandall.substack.com/p/john-lee-pettimore-mine-tailings?publication_id=1140581&post_id=110599532&isFreemail=true), the inevitable result of getting stuff out of the ground. (Incidently, since the grade of copper ore has fallen from 50% copper to 0.5%, the best place to mine it is sometimes in the tailings of old mines. The stuff they threw away back then is better than what we can mine right now.)

------------------------------------------
### Mar 25, 2023
+ There's been some [talk](https://forum.kicad.info/t/ai-artificial-intelligence/40642) on the KiCad forum about using AI for electronics design, [including yours truly](https://forum.kicad.info/t/ai-artificial-intelligence/40642/19?u=devbisme).
+ [Is Netflix headed the way of the History Channel?](https://billwadge.com/2023/03/25/a-bad-trip-to-infinity/)
+ A single 13-sided polykite can [tile a plane without ever repeating](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a43402074/mathematicians-discover-new-13-sided-shape/). That sound you hear is a million 3D printers warming up... 

------------------------------------------
### Mar 24, 2023
+ Not to get too hung-up on their demographic woes and super-low fertility rate, but here's an [article](https://www.thecut.com/2023/03/4b-movement-feminism-south-korea.html) on South Korea's 4B feminist movement that advocates for near-total avoidance of men. From some of the examples they give, can't really blame 'em...
+ [Building semantic search engines](https://sigmoidprime.com/post/searchthearxiv/) has now become easy with OpenAI's API. (Side note: Arxiv has *250,000 papers about machine learning!?* Who's doing all that?)
+ I wrote a [blog post](https://devbisme.github.io/skidl/skidl-meets-chatgpt-2023-03-23.html) about that Twitter discussion I had about concerning circuit design by having ChatGPT/GPT4 output SKiDL code.

------------------------------------------
### Mar 23, 2023
+ I had an exchange on Twitter yesterday about [using ChatGPT/GPT4 with SKiDL for designing electronics.](https://twitter.com/alexandrosM/status/1638727208809402369)

------------------------------------------
### Mar 22, 2023
+ Here's a [super simple guide](https://www.piratewires.com/p/run-alpaca-mac-locally-guide) to getting the Alpaca large language model running locally on your own machine rather than logging into something like ChatGPT.
+ [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) is "a new markup-based typsetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use." I like that Typst documents can include scripts whose outputs can be included in the text. Not sure how likely this is to unseat LaTeX in publishing academic papers. Some easy integration into Markdown docs like with MathJax might help adoption.
+ I didn't know they never had one before this, but [PyPi has started a blog.](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-03-21-welcome-to-the-pypi-blog/)
+ [Building a budget compute cluster.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35260049)
+ The West is popular in the West, [but not so much everywhere else](https://unherd.com/2023/03/how-russia-and-china-overtook-the-west/).

------------------------------------------
### Mar 21, 2023
+ Turns out *Nature*'s political endorsements didn't have any effect other than [decreasing trust in scientists](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00799-3?error=cookies_not_supported&code=c0ffc538-11db-4f86-a528-b6988549b177#Echobox=1679348459). Good job, guys!
+ Here's somebody who [got his hardware into the wild](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1703258614/psdr-pocket-hf-sdr-transceiver-with-vna-and-gps/posts/1930259) but the community to write software for it hasn't coalesced. That mirrors my experience when I was running XESS: you need to do a lot of hand-holding to get things rolling! Also, only about 50% of the dev boards you buy ever make it out of their antistatic bags.
+ More about [prompt engineering.](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/)
+ I tried giving ChatGPT a few descriptions from [commandlinefu.com](https://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse) and it did a pretty good job generating the command sequences. But then I realized that the whole site was probably part of the training set...
+ [A modern-day Rosetta Stone](https://longnow.org/ideas/very-long-term-backup/) containing the Book of Genesis in thousands of different languages etched into a nickel disk.

------------------------------------------
### Mar 20, 2023
+ It would be interesting to run these [14,166 function descriptions](https://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse) through GPT-4 and see how well it replicates the associated one-line linux command.
+ Tired of reading about "GPT this-or-that"? Here's a [random list of interesting projects.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#miscellaneous)

------------------------------------------
### Mar 19, 2023
+ Kids are [opting out of college](https://fortune.com/2023/03/09/american-skipping-college-huge-numbers-pandemic-turned-them-off-education/). The education-industrial complex is, of course, in panic. Good (and I say this as a former university faculty member).
+ I remember using it in the early 90's, but today it's a hard sell if you tell somebody [they can master EMACS in just one year.](https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide/blob/master/guide-en.org)
+ I love a good book-sharing site and sticking it to the Man. Here's how [Anna's Archive works](https://annas-blog.org/how-to-run-a-shadow-library.html).
+ Remember how the South Korean government wanted a 69-hour work week? Yeah, well [their people had something to say about that.](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/18/asia/south-korea-longer-work-week-debate-intl-hnk/index.html) (I also found out S. Korea *already had a 68-hour workweek* prior to 2018 when it was reduced to 52 hours.)
+ The [third installment](https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/the-arm-story-part-3-creating-a-global-1b0?publication_id=1063960&post_id=108762776&isFreemail=true) of the ARM story just dropped.
+ Here's a link to a [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/gfodor/status/1637323490390073349) about a prompt that tries to elicit novel ideas from GPT4.

------------------------------------------
### Mar 18, 2023
+ Looks like [OpenAI doesn't think it's a good idea to be so open](https://twitter.com/jjvincent/status/1636065237500588033). Well, you shouldn't have put "open" in your fucking name! Looks like Microsoft found a good place to burn all the goodwill they earned back over the past decade...
+ Vaclav Smil wrote a lot of [good articles for IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/vaclav-smil), but looks like that may be over. Nothing new since Nov/2022. Maybe he wasn't sufficiently on-board the green energy train.
+ People are all right with authoritarianism if it's [packaged attractively](https://areomagazine.com/2023/03/15/cute-authoritarianism/).

------------------------------------------
### Mar 17, 2023
+ [Here](https://science.xyz/services/foundry) is a foundry service where you can build your own MEMS devices.
+ Experiment with AI [Transformers in your browser](https://xenova.github.io/transformers.js/).
+ [Codon](https://news.mit.edu/2023/codon-python-based-compiler-achieve-orders-magnitude-speedups-0314) is a compiler for speeding-up Python programs. As usual, it "can’t support certain dynamic features" of Python. It doesn't say which ones or how much this limits its general usefulness.
+ Here's a list from Nov/2022 of [capabilities emerging from large language models](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/emergence). Who knows how many more have been added by now...

------------------------------------------
### Mar 16, 2023
+ Whenever buying a car is discussed, my wife always gravitates to expensive cars with loads of safety features. My response: "You want safety? Don't use a cell phone while the car's moving. Boom! [You're safer than 77% of the drivers out there](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-03-14/deaths-broken-limbs-distracted-driving) and it costs nothing. Now, how about that [Fiero](https://www.motor1.com/news/132346/worst-sports-cars-pontiac-fiero/)?"
+ Around 1980, society started shifting from a collective to an individualistic viewpoint according to an [analysis of the language used in millions of books](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/940009). It will be interesting to see if this starts to shift back given the emphasis on acting for the collective good by some segments of the population during the COVID crisis.
+ [Terrifying plastic rocks](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/brazilian-researchers-find-terrifying-plastic-rocks-remote-island-2023-03-15/) are evidence of how our profligate consumerism is destroying the environment. But fishing nets comprise most of these rocks, so unless you're running a trawler ... 

------------------------------------------
### Mar 15, 2023
+ South Korea's [Samsung is building a $230B chip fabrication complex](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/15/tech/korea-chips-investment-hnk-intl/index.html), but over the span of 20 years. Gotta compare that to Taiwan's [TSMC spending $44B on capital expenditures](https://www.eetimes.com/tsmc-expects-44-billion-in-capex-despite-slowdown-concerns/) in a single year. 

------------------------------------------

+ Well, [GPT-4](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf) got released today. So did [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude).
+ [This paper](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/35/3/287/111335/Understanding-and-Applying-Deep-Learning) fosters "an intuitive understanding of convolutional network deep learning models and how to use them with the goal of engaging a wider creative community."
+ Thirteen amino acids and a couple of nickel ions may have [started life on Earth](https://www.rutgers.edu/news/rutgers-scientists-identify-substance-may-have-sparked-life-earth): Simple enough to arise spontaneously and reactive enough to catalyze hydrogen to power primitive metabolic processes.
+ Ha! This guy just came out with a book about the [hardest thing in programming!](https://www.namingthings.co/)

### Mar 13, 2023
+ Here's a list of [single-webpage AI projects](https://hpssjellis.github.io/my-examples-of-huggingfacejs/public/index.html) using the huggingface.js library.
+ I've always been interested in the [Demoscene](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Demoscene) and how their members are able to get such striking visuals and animations from so little code. Here's an example of a [jellyfish animation](https://www.geeks3d.com/hacklab/20210902/jellyfish-tweet-shader/) that fits in a single tweet.
+ Just imagine if the resources the US government put into this [insignificant case](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/social-media-influencer-charged-election-interference-stemming-voter-disinformation-campaign) were redirected into domestic infrastructure...

### Mar 12, 2023
+ This article shows [how to use the ChatGPT API](https://minimaxir.com/2023/03/new-chatgpt-overlord/) and includes links to working Jupyter Colab notebooks.
+ [De-escalation of LLM models continues](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/11/llama/): now they can run on a laptop CPU.
+ A complete [connectome for an insect larva "brain"](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-the-first-complete-map-of-an-insects-brain-180981778/) with 3,000 neurons and 550,000 synapses.

+ The Flynn Effect is the 3-5 point increase of a population's IQ each decade since the 1930s, but looks like we've [managed to reverse that](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289623000156#f0005).
+ Another example from ["How Big Things Get Done"](https://www.amazon.com/How-Big-Things-Get-Done/dp/0593239512/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=how+big+things+get+done&qid=1677799915&sr=8-1) is in the news: the [current projected cost of California's high-speed rail](https://calmatters.org/transportation/2023/03/california-high-speed-rail/) from SF to LA is now up to $100B. Oh well, I guess that's still better than throwing the money at the Ukraine war...
+ All this time we were told the "free energy" videos on Youtube were scams, but now it looks like we've found an enzyme that [generates electricity just from the traces of hydrogen in the air.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/scientists-discover-how-to-make-electricity-out-of-thin-air/ar-AA18mQr2?ocid=msedgntp&cvid=88bb0529f474423b9d99bcaf6d7b43b9&ei=464)

### Mar 7, 2023
+ Here's a list of [interesting publishers in the tech world](https://arbesman.net/publishing).
+ Multimodal models that operate on several types of input data (text, image, etc.) are now heating up. [Here's one from NVIDIA labs](https://shikun.io/projects/prismer) that's completely [open-sourced](https://github.com/NVlabs/prismer). Makes sense since NVIDIA's money comes from hardware and they would benefit by having their model widely used.
+ And here's a [curated list of software engineering blogs](https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs) that you'll never get around to reading...
+ Brush your teeth so you don't [die of a heart attack](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-023-5507-4). Also, mouthwash kills bacteria that [help to lower blood pressure](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/09/190903111242.htm). So what the hell...

------------------------------------------
### Mar 6, 2023
+ This [Quora answer](https://qr.ae/prcjEt) demonstrates how doing something different from everyone else can give you a marked leg-up in a competition (in this case, shooting down airplanes). It's similar to the success a football coach had when he decided to [flip the 70%-30% ratio of run-versus-pass plays to 30%-70%](https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Pass-American-Reinvention-Football/dp/1501116193).
+ Of course, doing something different doesn't always lead to success. [This paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228178742_Pioneer_Advantage_Marketing_Logic_or_Marketing_Legend) shows that first entrants  ("pioneers") only capture 10% of a new market and seldom maintain their leadership over a later entrant that gains 28% of the market. 

------------------------------------------
### Mar 5, 2023
+ I haven't read this entire [article](https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2023/03/05/science-magazine-touts-the-existence-of-strong-and-ubiquitous-implicit-bias-as-well-as-the-need-to-measure-it-and-develoop-ways-to-eliminate-it/) because I've kinda stopped caring about the whole racist/anti-racist back-and-forth, but I'm *really* tired of publications like *Science*, *Nature* and *Scientific American* becoming so overtly political in their coverage (even to the point of endorsing political candidates).
+ There is now a [tufte.css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) for formatting your HTML articles in the clear, minimalistic style of Edward Tufte. Although not the main focus, [Tufte-LaTeX](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/) is also mentioned.
+ A hospital in Canada has [surgically grafted healthy nerves onto the damaged ones of a dozen quadrapelgics](https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2023/03/02/a-new-surgery-gives-quadriplegic-patients-the-use-of-their-hands-and-arms/) to restore the use of their arms and hands. (This is a press release from the hospital, not a peer-reviewed article.)

### Mar 3, 2023
+ Looks like someone was able to [reconstruct the images being viewed](https://github.com/yu-takagi/StableDiffusionReconstruction) by feeding fMRI scan data from the language and visual areas of a brain into a Stable Diffusion model.
+ Somebody submitted a [PR to Meta's LLaMa Github repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/pull/73/files) with a link to a torrent of the model weights. (Normally, Meta wants you to submit a form to get access to those.) In case it vanishes, [here it is](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ZXXDAUWYLRUXXBHUYEMS6Q5CE5WA3LVA&dn=LLaMA): magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ZXXDAUWYLRUXXBHUYEMS6Q5CE5WA3LVA&dn=LLaMA

------------------------------------------
### Mar 2, 2023
+ I'm reading a book called ["How Big Things Get Done"](https://www.amazon.com/How-Big-Things-Get-Done/dp/0593239512/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=how+big+things+get+done&qid=1677799915&sr=8-1). At one point, it discusses the construction of the Empire State building which was done in about 12 months from start to finish. This [blog post](https://constructionphysics.substack.com/p/construction-productivity-structural) contrasts that project with the building of the World Trade Center and shows that the workers on the Empire State building were 2x - 4x more productive. And [this blog post](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-build-nothing-country?publication_id=35345&post_id=105353895&isFreemail=true) bemoans the fact that America can't seem to build *anything*.

### Mar 1, 2023
+ Iran must be making one *hell* of a ["nukelear" reactor](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-64810145)!
+ Politicians are slowly [waking up](https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/06/22/germany-refuses-to-agree-to-eu-ban-on-new-fossil-fuel-cars-from-2035) to the fact that they can't just legislate and expect the atoms to fall in line...
+ [Good luck, kids.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/half-of-todays-5-year-olds-will-live-to-be-100)
+ If I ever got around to making a game, I'd look seriously at [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot). It's getting to that Blender level of critical mass.
+ The AI LLM of the day is ... [KOSMOS-1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14045.pdf)! This one works with different types of data (text & images) and can do things like explain what's going on in a picture or understand the text in an image without using OCR.
+ OpenAI has released [APIs to ChatGPT and Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis). In addition, there is an upcoming [ChatML](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/chatml.md) format that lets you interact with GPT models using JSON-formatted data. 
+ Operating at a lower level than things like GPT, [JAX](https://colinraffel.com/blog/you-don-t-know-jax.html) augments Pyton's `numpy` to make it easier to perform machine learning operations.
+ Need a QR code for a URL? [Here's](https://python.plainenglish.io/generating-qr-codes-using-python-in-few-simple-steps-752f4d8dac2d) a set of Python function calls that does it.

### Feb 28, 2023
+ Looks like you're not going to get that eco-friendly lettuce from a [vertical farm](https://www.fastcompany.com/90824702/vertical-farming-failing-profitable-appharvest-aerofarms-bowery). Oh, and that ethically-pure lab-grown meat? [Not getting that, either.](https://thecounter.org/lab-grown-cultivated-meat-cost-at-scale/)
+ I know you're looking forward to the government slapping some [more regulations on working-from-home](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/work-from-home-regulations-are-coming-companies-arent-ready/). But don't worry! You'll only have to endure them for [four days a week.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/02/21/four-day-work-week-results-uk/)
+ Meta open-sourced their version of GPT-3 called [LLaMa](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) which uses 10x fewer parameters while getting better performance. Now there's an [open-source version of ChatGPT](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebullvm/tree/main/apps/accelerate/chatllama) built with it.
+ [Here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34964000) is a page with suggested links for keeping up on current AI developments, along with an [older post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33369800) about how to get started in learning AI.

### Feb 26, 2023
+ [In-Q-Tel](https://www.iqt.org/) is basically the venture capital arm of the US intelligence community (think CIA). Here is one of [their reports](https://assets.iqt.org/pdfs/The_Biorevolution_Feb_2023.pdf/web/viewer.html) describing how the ability to both read and *write* DNA will affect national security and economic competitiveness.

------------------------------------------
### Feb 25, 2023
+ I updated my [KiCad on Docker repo](https://github.com/devbisme/docker_kicad) so it supports versions 5, 6 and 7. Now I can run any of those versions with a simple command like `kicad5` and they don't interfere with each other.

------------------------------------------
### Feb 24, 2023
+ I ordered one of these [CH32V003 RISC-V microcontroller dev kits](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804709476544.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.1.725670cdLyYDkV&algo_pvid=695670c4-a9f6-4d50-833c-17991705eead&algo_exp_id=695670c4-a9f6-4d50-833c-17991705eead-0&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2212000030983160842%22%7D&pdp_npi=3%40dis%21USD%2112.5%2111.87%21%21%21%21%21%40210212c016772437895204285d0724%2112000030983160842%21sea%21US%21162974069&curPageLogUid=IVAZeaas6Tv2). Shipping is more than the cost of the kit!
+ [AlphaCode](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/competitive-programming-with-alphacode) is an AI from DeepMind specifically aimed at the task of generating good solutions for competitive coding contests.

------------------------------------------
### Feb 23, 2023
+ I pointed to [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) a few days ago and now here's a [Mermaid cheatsheet](https://jojozhuang.github.io/tutorial/mermaid-cheat-sheet/) for doing similar text-based graphics within a Markdown file. All these things seem to rely on the remarkably long-lived [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) tool.

------------------------------------------
### Feb 22, 2023
+ Looks like we have another web-based PCB design suite: [Flux](https://docs.flux.ai/). Your design is stored in their central database and I'm not sure if you can export your design files. So what happens if the company ceases to exist or if the server is just down?
+ [Lots of interest in demographics](https://stenoresearch.com/watch-series/introducing-the-problem-index-which-countries-have-the-worst-demographics/) since the developed/developing world has a problem keeping their birthrates above replacement level. Check out the [South Korean birthrate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-22/south-korea-fertility-rate-falls-again-adding-to-economic-risks).

### Feb 21, 2023
+ This [Dockerfile](https://github.com/code2k13/pipico_build_setup) gives you a self-contained build environment for Raspberry Pico programs.
+ Want to program the 10&cent; [CH32V003 microcontroller](http://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH32V003.html) but hate the idea of using their proprietary tools? This [repo](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun) supports an open source alternative using GCC.
+ [Extensive guide](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide) to prompt engineering for various generative AI tools.
+ Here's a [large categorized list of EDA tools](https://hdl.github.io/awesome/) for describing electronic systems.

### Feb 20, 2023
+ Raspberry Pi is selling a [small hardware debug module](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-debug-probe-a-plug-and-play-debug-kit-for-12/) to make it easier to access the SWD port of a Pico (or any other ARM processor).
+ Just to maintain the ARM theme, here's [part 1](https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/the-arm-story-part-1-from-acorns-6e2?publication_id=1063960&post_id=100242940&isFreemail=true) and [part 2](https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/the-arm-story-part-2-archimedes-to-4fd) of a history about ARM.
+ [Here's](https://github.com/Ying1123/FlexGen) another FOSS solution for running large language modules with just a single GPU.

------------------------------------------
### Feb 19, 2023
+ Somewhere on my travels through ChatGPT-land, I ran across [Colossal-AI](https://www.hpc-ai.tech/blog/colossal-ai-chatgpt), a FOSS toolkit for replicating ChatGPT using fewer compute resources (i.e., GPUs) and with faster training. I'm not expert enough and haven't tried it to see if that's true or just BS. But it's open source so you can look for yourself.
+ If you're into making animated visualizations in the browser, [SwissGL](https://github.com/google/swissgl) is a minimalistic wrapper on top of the WebGL2 JS API. This looks like a quick way to get GPU-assisted visualizations onto the web.
+ [What will soda cans look like in forty years?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/116f83f/given_how_soda_cans_have_changed_over_the_years/)

------------------------------------------
### Feb 18, 2023
+ I was reading this [article](https://aruva.medium.com/using-chatgpt-to-build-system-diagrams-part-i-69efc7603926) about using ChatGPT to create system modeling diagrams by having it output markdown containing Mermaid (which is amazing by itself). But this led me to the FOSS tool [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) that lets you generate many types of diagrams from a text description: UML, mindmaps, mathematics, etc. Using ChatGPT to drive text-based tools like these with natural language inputs gives them capabilities that aren't readily available in GUI-based tools.
+ Interesting [article](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/16/ukraine-russia-war-drone-warfare-china/) about how both Ukraine and Russia are somewhat dependent upon drones from a private company ([DJI](https://www.dji.com/)) in China. DJI has applied geofencing to restrict the use of their drones in wars in the Middle East, but not in Ukraine (so far).

### Feb 17, 2023
+ Meta is handing out a lot of [negative reviews to its workers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/og-mark-returns-at-meta-as-facebook-parent-gives-thousands-of-staff-subpar-reviews-56e648b4). It also wants to [solve the noise problem](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-metas-push-to-solve-the-noisy-office-ba43042) in its offices. I guess having fewer employees would be one way to do that...
+ This [article](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/) covers how ChatGPT works. Along the way, it talks about models, neural nets, training, embeddings, semantics, etc. I haven't read it in detail, but I plan to. Better than reading WSJ articles about Meta...

------------------------------------------
### Feb 16, 2023
+ I use [PySpice](https://pypi.org/project/PySpice/) as a Python interface to ngspice to provide circuit simulation capabilities in [SKiDL](https://github.com/devbisme/skidl). Now there's a fork called [OpenSPICE](https://github.com/thejackal360/OpenSPICE) that adds a native Python simulator. There's not a lot of documentation I could find outside of [this article](https://hackaday.com/2023/02/14/openspice-a-portable-python-circuit-simulator/). In the comments, there's also a link to [PyLTSpice](https://pypi.org/project/PyLTSpice/) which lets you drive LTSpice through a Python interface.

------------------------------------------
### Feb 15, 2023
+ I've always been interested in forecasting, even though I suck at it. [Superforecasting](https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock-ebook/dp/B00RKO6MS8) is a great book on how to make better predictions of the future, and [this article](https://www.arcdigital.media/p/superforecasters-in-the-cosmic-bazaar?r=lle6p) is a good, broad-brush exposition of the principles.
+ I frequently use the website [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) to get rid of backgrounds in images I want to use as clip-art. I just ran across the [rembg](https://pypi.org/project/rembg/#description) Python package that does the same thing locally, and the code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg).

+ Maybe you're like me: sometimes you use Pandas, but you don't really *know* Pandas. If so, [this *extensive* visual guide to Pandas](https://betterprogramming.pub/pandas-illustrated-the-definitive-visual-guide-to-pandas-c31fa921a43) may be for you. (Note: This is hosted on Medium so you may be able to view it or you may not. Who knows...) And if actually learning how it works is too much, there's a Python package called [sketch](https://pypi.org/project/sketch/) that uses AI to assist you in using Pandas.

### Feb 13, 2023
+ Looks like Z Library [isn't going down without a fight](https://torrentfreak.com/z-library-returns-on-the-clearnet-in-full-hydra-mode-230213/).
+ I'm a big fan of using programming languages for doing CAD work. [GhostSCAD]() puts a Go wrapper around OpenSCAD to achieve that. CadQuery (Python) and JSCad (Javascript) are other alternatives mentioned in the comments.
+ [Maya Posch](https://hackaday.com/author/mayaposch/) writes a lot of good articles at Hackaday like this one on [methane pyrolysis](https://hackaday.com/2023/02/13/methane-pyrolysis-producing-green-hydrogen-without-carbon-emissions/). Also check out the [mining and refining](https://hackaday.com/tag/mining-and-refining/) section by [Dan Maloney](https://hackaday.com/author/dpsm64/) for facts about the stuff that makes up our industrial society.

------------------------------------------
### Feb 12, 2023
+ Japan is going [full bore on nuclear](https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/business/companies/20230210-90175/). Looks like the government will be paying for their share of the build-out by charging "carbon fees" to companies using fossil fuels.
+ Looks like Intel Foundry service [isn't going to be directly supporting RISC-V](https://www.electropages.com/blog/2023/01/intel-terminates-risc-v-development-project-what-happened).

------------------------------------------
### Feb 11, 2023
+ You can get a lot of prepackaged Docker containers for FOSS EDA tools [here](https://hdl.github.io/containers/). [This page](https://hdl.github.io/containers/ToolsAndImages.html) lists the available tools. Most of these are HDL/FPGA/VLSI design tools so don't expect to get containers for things like KiCad and FreeCAD.
+ A while ago, I built a [Docker container for KiCad](https://github.com/devbisme/docker_kicad5). It's for version 5, but it should be easy to modify it for versions 6 and 7 (when it becomes available).

------------------------------------------
### Feb 10, 2023
+ [Here's](https://www.hackster.io/news/one-man-s-trash-is-another-man-s-compute-cluster-b6735c5d8385) the latest effort to repurpose old smartphones into a compute cluster. Unfortunately, the phones are loaded with the [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubuntu-touch.io/) linux variant and that isn't supported on any of the old phones I have lieing around.
+ A couple of pro-nuke articles about [uninformed fears of nuclear waste](https://zionlights.substack.com/p/everything-i-believed-about-waste-was-wrong) and [the nuclear renaissance](https://quillette.com/2023/02/09/the-dawn-of-nuclear-energy-abundance/).

------------------------------------------
### Feb 9, 2023
+ Instead of [running Doom on a soldering iron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCC941xKuBs), it seems the new trend is to implement ChatGPT in as few lines as possible. [Here's one](https://jaykmody.com/blog/gpt-from-scratch/) that does it in 60 lines of NumPy.

+ I finished ["How to Drive a Nuclear Reactor"](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Nuclear-Reactor-Springer-Praxis/dp/3030338754). It describes the systems of a **P**ressurized **W**ater **R**eactor (the most common type) and how a control-room operator starts, manages, and stops it. It's a bit more technical than your standard popsci book, but not as challenging as a textbook. Worth a read if you're interested in nuclear power.
+ [Helion Energy](https://research.contrary.com/reports/helion-energy) is trying to build a 50MW fusion reactor that fits in a shipping container and costs $10M by 2030. Seems wildly optimistic but I look forward to being surprised.

+ Over the course of my life, I've noticed that being smart (or being acknowledged as smart) has ascended in importance. But I would say that most people labeled as smart are merely *adept* (skilled within some area of knowledge). I think that [OODA](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/OODA_loop) provides a better framework to judge a person's intelligence by seeing if they can 1) **O**bserve things others don't notice, 2) **O**rient them into an existing set of facts, 3) **D**ecide what to do based on this new knowledge, and 4) actually **A**ct upon their decision. The number of people who can do this in one field, much less many, is *extremely* small. They often don't fit the stereotype of *smart*. And I am not one of them.
+ There's been a lot of talk-talk recently by US "thought leaders" about re-emphasizing manufacturing. [This article](https://danwang.co/definite-optimism-as-human-capital/) beats the same drum, except it's from 2017. So the talk has been going on for a while. Despite things like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (LOL), I'm still waiting to see increases in manufacturing employment. Or lots and lots of robots...

+ Interesting [blog post by Jay Carlson](https://jaycarlson.net/2023/02/04/the-cheapest-flash-microcontroller-you-can-buy-is-actually-an-arm-cortex-m0/) about a new Cortex-M0+ microcontroller that costs less than 10&#162;.
